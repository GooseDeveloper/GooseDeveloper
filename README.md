## Who _is_ this guy?
Hello! My name is *******, but you can call me `@01556`. I've been coding for over a 18 months, and I've discovered the best part of programming: making software with the people, for the people. I've designed several projects so far, and I've since decided to code a few on Github!

## My projects
Here's a list of projects I've finished, am working on, or plan to implement:

## Main technologies/workflows
My primary programming language is C, but I've made a few projects in NodeJS, Golang, and even `sh`! The majority of my C projects conform to ANSI C, make minimal use of the standard library (usually just `stdio`), and live entirely on the stack, meaning they're very efficient and run with <2MB of ram. I have a few configuration repositories, which are listed below:

## How to reach me
You can reach me by [email](mailto:addison.brendtro+toaster@gmail.com) or on [discord](https://discordapp.com/users/630397435805696020). I also have a Youtube channel, but I'm leaving it out for now, since I haven't uploaded anything yet.
